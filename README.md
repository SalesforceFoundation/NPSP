#### Important Note ####

In [March](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/new-nonprofit-cloud/) of 2023, Salesforce launched the Nonprofit Cloud which is at the foundation of Salesforce for Nonprofits to help teams unify their data to work beyond silos and better collaborate, share, learn from, and use their data. Nonprofit Cloud provides you with a single solution to begin or continue in your digital transformation journey. Read the full post on Nonprofit Cloud [here](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazer-community/feed/0D54S00000JgVp5SAF) and [here](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazer-community/feed/0D54V00007NA7v2SAD). Some keyhighlights are below:
* Salesforce will to continue support our existing managed package products, including the Nonprofit Success Pack. 10’s of thousands of customers, like yourselves, are using our current products, and we know that you are achieving great results. In our planned upcoming releases, we have enhancements designed for both our new and our existing solutions. Many of our ISV partners have fantastic integrations with our current products - we are working with them to ensure that they understand our new product architecture, and are able to bring their years of experience and learnings into the new Nonprofit Cloud.
* Salesforce remains deeply committed to nonprofit pricing. Although there are many new capabilities within the new Nonprofit Cloud, from other parts of Salesforce, we have worked hard to maintain our nonprofit discounts across the new products. Our goals here are to simplify access to nonprofit cloud technology, and to make it easier for customers to get started and to get different user roles working together, nothing more.  
* Salesforce will continue to grant free licenses with the Power of Us Program. This is the first time that we’ve been able to expand the Power of Us program to include nonprofit specific products, and we are very excited about the potential for these new inclusions to accelerate and deepen the nonprofit experience.
