Instead, install your NPSP upgrade in one of your free sandbox environments, or a developer organization first.\r\n\r\n**If you are upgrading from NPSP 2, you will need to do a step *before* running this installer. First, upgrade only the Recurring Donations package to version 3.10 by running the installer:**\r\n\r\n* [Install Recurring Donations 3.10 in Production or Developer Edition orgs](https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t80000000tpCB)\r\n* [Install Recurring Donations 3.10 in Sandbox orgs](https://test.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t80000000tpCB)\r\n\r\nBe sure to Install for All Users and follow the prompts. Once the Recurring Donations package has been updated, you can proceed with the complete installation of Nonprofit Success Pack here. If you do not upgrade the Recurring Donations package first, you will get an error in the installer that can only be resolved by installing the Recurring Donations 3.10 package. You do not need to do this step if you already have a prior version of the Nonprofit Success Pack package (version 3.0 or later).",
