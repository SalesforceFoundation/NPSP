        <h2>Nonprofit Success Pack Codebase Documentation</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the wonderful world of development in the NPSP. We've tried hard to fully document our codebase so that external developers can get acclimated and quickly contribute to the project. Thanks for taking the time to review this documentation and considering contributing to the project!</p>
        <br/>
        <p><b>Note:</b> this documentation is currently outdated due to an issue with the automatic parsing of NPSP code comments that generates this site. Until that's fixed, you can get the the latest information directly in the <a href="https://github.com/SalesforceFoundation/Cumulus/">NPSP github repository.</a></p>
