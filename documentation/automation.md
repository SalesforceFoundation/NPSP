## Key Workflows

This section summarizes the key workflows for developers, QEs, and technical
writers.

| Workflow                 | Flow                           | Org Type       | Managed | Namespaced |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------ | -------------- | ------- | ---------- |
| Development              | `dev_org`                      | `dev`            |         |            |
| Development (Namespaced) | `dev_org_namespaced`           | `dev_namespaced` |         | ✔          |
| QA                       | `qa_org`                       | `dev`            |         |            |
| QA (Namespaced)          | `qa_org_namespaced`            | `dev_namespaced`            |         | ✔          |

| Trial (Clone of TSO)     | None (`cci org browser trial`) | `trial`          | ✔       |            |

### Org Definitions

NPSP includes many org definitions tailored for testing - in particular, beta testing - of the product in a variety of org shapes.

Differences between these orgs are relatively slight. All orgs specify a required core set of features for NPSP:

 - Chatter
 - Enhanced Notes
 - Lightning

Additionally, depending on the intended use case of the org, features for development may be enabled:

 - Translation Workbench (Dev, Feature, Enterprise, and Prelease)
 - Disabled Lightning cache (Dev and Feature)
 - Disabled parallel Apex testing (All)
 - Enable Admin to Login As Any User (Dev, Feature and Beta)
 - Enhanced Profile UI (Dev, Feature and Beta)

as well as many other features needed to define the workspace for the org's intended purpose.

## Data Sets

### Data Cleanup Tasks

| Name                          | Type | Description                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `test_data_delete` | Task | Delete all records NPSP related data including Opportunity, Account, Contact, RecurringDonation, Level, Engagement Plan, Data Import and Errors |
| `purge_npsp_errors` | Task | Deletes all records in the Error__c object  |
| `ldv_data_delete` | Flow | Hard Deletes all records NPSP related data including Opportunity, Account, Contact, RecurringDonation, Level, Engagement Plan, Data Import and Errors. Disables Triggers and other logic first to opimize performance and prevent errors. Use this when deleting large amounts of data in an org. |

### Dev Org Data Set

This data set includes most NPSP objects and is scaled based on 100 Contacts.

| Deploy Task         | Capture Task | Delete Task        |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| `test_data_dev_org` |              | `test_data_delete` |

For managed orgs, the mapping must be manually set to `datasets/mapping-managed.yml`.

### 1K Data Set

This data set includes most NPSP objects and is scaled based on 1024 Contacts.

| Deploy Task    | Capture Task | Delete Task        |
| -------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| `test_data_1k` |              | `test_data_delete` |

For managed orgs, the mapping must be manually set to `datasets/mapping-managed.yml`.

### 100K Data Set

This data set includes most NPSP objects and is scaled based on 102,400 Contacts. This data set will not fit in a standard scratch org, which holds approximately 100,000 total records.

The SQLite data set is not included in the repo due to its size. It is present in the persistent `LDV100k` org.

| Deploy Task      | Capture Task | Delete Task        |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| `test_data_100k` |              | `test_data_delete` |

For managed orgs, the mapping must be manually set to `datasets/mapping-managed.yml`.

### LDV Flexible Data Set

This uses Snowfakery to generate a data set up to millions of records. The default is 1000 Contacts and related Opportunities with Relationships and Allocations.
The `ldv_test_data_rd2` flow generates these using [Enhanced] Recurring Donation records, while the `ldv_test_data` flow generates data without related Recurring Donation records. 

Special Notes for the `ldv_test_data_rd2` flow:
- Requires Enhanced Recurring Donations to be enabled first. Use the `enable_rd2` flow to do this.
- Future RD Installment Opportunities are not created automatically during the data load. This can be done separately by executing the RD batch job through NPSP Settings.

| Deploy Flow    | Options | Delete Task        |
| -------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| `ldv_test_data_rd2` | `-o generate_and_load_from_yaml__num_records {NumberOfContacts}` | `ldv_data_delete` |
| `ldv_test_data` | `-o generate_and_load_from_yaml__num_records {NumberOfContacts}` | `ldv_data_delete` |

For managed orgs, the mapping must be manually set to `datasets/mapping-managed.yml`.

### BDI Benchmark Data Set

This data set is generated dynamically for BDI performance testing. No data set is stored.

| Deploy Task     | Capture Task | Delete Task |
| --------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| `test_data_bdi` |              |             |

### XXL Data Set

This data set is not stored in the repo, but lives in a Postgres database on Heroku due to its size. This data set can only be deployed to LDV performance testing sandboxes. Such deployments should be planned in advance with Release Engineering.
